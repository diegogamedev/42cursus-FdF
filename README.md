This is the 5th of 6 projects, from stage 1 of [42 Cursus](https://42.fr/en/homepage/ "42 Cursus"), this project was approved with 125 out of 100

**Subject:**

> This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in French,
hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points
(x, y, z) via segments

To test this piece of software, you'll need all the requirements to run the [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux "minilibx") (a graphic library created by 42), as well as a Linux/Mac environment.
To use it, first run *make* to generate the executable, then use ./fdf together with a relative path to an .fdf file, the folder [maps](https://github.com/diegogamedev/42cursus-FdF/tree/master/maps "maps") has a bunch of sample maps

**Controls**

WASD to translate the camera on a 2D plane
QE to perform a  yaw rotation on the projection
Arrows to perform roll and pitch rotations on the projection
Left Shift and Left Control to zoom in/out (a.k.a translate in the Z axis)
